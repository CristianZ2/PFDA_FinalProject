# Project Title: Road Kill


Repository: `https://github.com/CristianZ2/PFDA_FinalProject.git`

# Description:

I will be creating a game where the player will be controlling a character by moving with the **ASDW keys**. The main goal is for the player to **safely cross the character across the street, and put a `win prompt`** if successfully crossed or a `lost prompt` if failed to cross.

# Features: 

**Win Prompt**
- If the player advances without touching enemy cpu’s then a `win prompt` will display. 

**Lose Prompt**
- If the player touches enemy cpu, they lose and a `lose prompt` will display.

**Enemy CPUs**
- Enemy CPUs will move around back and forth to prohibit players from advancing.

**Background image**
- Image will be the environment that will be displayed behind the playable area.

**Foreground image**
- The images will be the enemy cpu’s and the player character that will interact with each other. 

**Player Control**
- Player will control the character with key inputs moving forward, backwards, side to side.

# Challenges: 
1. The first challenge I will need to research is how to delete the player character once it 2. touches the enemy cpu and display the `lose prompt`. 

2. The second challenge will be to display the `win prompt` once the player character advances to the next level.

3. The third challenge will be to **display the number of levels** the player has completed. 


# Outcomes:

- The ideal outcome I want to have for this project is that it runs without crashing because this will tell me that the code is good. The other outcome will be to make the game playable and not difficult to play but have the player understand the mechanics of the game. 

- The Minimal Viable Outcome will be if the player can move the character and even complete a level. Also try to display one of the prompts.




# Milestone:

## April 14-20
- Create `BG image` that display
- Create enemy `cpu’s and player character class` that display them
- Display score, `win prompt, and lose prompt`

## April 21-27
- Create control inputs for the player character to move
- Create movement for the enemy cpu’s
- Create collusion between enemy cpu’s and player character

## April 28- May 5
- Display `win prompt` once player pass level
- Display `lose prompt` once player collides with enemy cpu
- `Tally the score of levels` that players pass. 

## May 6-12
- Playtest game to make sure it does not crash
- Debug code to make sure it runs smoothly
- Clean up code to make it readable
